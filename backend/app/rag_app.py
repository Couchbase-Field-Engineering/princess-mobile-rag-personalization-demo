"""The concierge's registration as an AOM **RAG Application**.

AOM's RAG Applications page lists registered apps (`/v1/rag/apps`) and
their activity: queries, LLM cache hits and Context Cache retrievals, all
attributed by the `rag:<app_id>:` namespace prefix.

The app is scoped to exactly one Knowledge Base document, today's Guest
Services Playbook, because a RAG query answers from whatever its role can
read, and the `support_agent` role can also read every guest profile the
daily loader publishes. Without the scope, a generic question from one guest
could retrieve another guest's profile. Personal questions don't go through
the app's /query endpoint. The concierge builds those itself, with retrieval
pinned to the asking guest's own profile document.

The playbook document gets a new id every day, so the loader calls `sync()`
after each publish to point the app at the new one. `scripts/register_with_aom.py`
creates the app the first time.
